It was summer of 2022. This was favourite time of students as summer vacation just started. Prachi's family had big surprise planned for Prachi and her siblings, Sakshi and Parth. Hustle bustle started and Prachi's family started preparation for going to city of dreams. Passports for all arrived just in time. Soon time passed and finally the day came, when Prachi and her family had to board the flight to London.

Prachi had butterflies in her stomach and was really excited for the trip.
